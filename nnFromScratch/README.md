Project done for the ECE 49595 CV course at Purdue University, Fall 2025.
Premise: Development of a Neural Network from scratch (without using libraries like Tensorflow or PyTorch) to predict the output of the XOR operation and binary addition function.
Constraints: No libraries allowed except basic utility modules (e.g., math or random), execution time under five minutes on the university compute cluster.
Skills used:
- Deep understanding of the architecture and mathematical principles underlying Neural Networks, including forward and backpropagation.
- Data set generation from scratch, including the injection of synthetic noise into the XOR dataset for augmentation.
- Hyperparameter tuning of the learning rate, network topology (structure), the number of epochs, and the training/testing data split.
Result: A scalable Neural Network which achieves a 100% testing accuracy across both models despite the speed constraints.
Possible further improvements: Control for overfitting using a validation set, addition of Batch Normalization, Adam optimization, L1/L2 regularization, scaling to more complex problems, etc...
